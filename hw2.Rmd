Set up:
```{r setup, echo = FALSE}
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
abalone <- read_csv("abalone.csv")
abalone
```


Question 1:
```{r cars}
#Your goal is to predict abalone age, which is calculated as the number of rings #plus 1.5. Notice there currently is no age variable in the data set. Add age to #the data set.

#Assess and describe the distribution of age.

ages <- abalone %>% 
  mutate(age = rings + 1.5)
hist(ages$age)
```


include explanation here

Question 2


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#Split the abalone data into a training set and a testing set. Use stratified #sampling. You should decide on appropriate percentages for splitting the data.

#Remember that youâ€™ll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to #reproduce your results.

set.seed(1500)
train = abalone[1:3000,]  
test = abalone[3001:4177]  
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
